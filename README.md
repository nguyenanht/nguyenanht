Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Right now I'm working as a Machine Learning engineer at [DreamQuark](https://www.dreamquark.com/) after 1 year and a half as a CTO et co-founder at [Umamy](https://umamy.fr).

I do love solving continuous pipeline of Machine Learning problem (pre-processing on the fly and in real time, training by batch, deployment with shadowing concept).  I also love to solve engineering problem to automate everything possible.
